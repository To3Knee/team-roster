 Welcome, DEV heroes, to the HIGH FIVE LICENSE‚Äîa sacred pact of palm-slapping, code-sharing glory! This license governs the use of the TO3KNEE projects. By downloading, using, or sharing this software, you agree to spread the high-five love across the universe (or at least your server room). Here‚Äôs the deal:

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION

 0. **To Download**: You must give a HIGH FIVE‚Äîvirtual, real, or imagined. Picture yourself slapping palms with a fellow automation nerd, shouting ‚ÄúSHAKE IT!‚Äù for extra zest. Bonus points if you do it in front of a server rack. No high five? No worries‚Äîyour enthusiasm is enough to unlock the download!

 1. **To Use**: Unleash a SUPER HIGH, LOUD, TURBO-CHARGED HIGH FIVE that echoes through the data center! Yell ‚ÄúBOOM!‚Äù at the top of your lungs (or whisper it if you‚Äôre in a quiet office). For maximum effect, pair it with a quick dev-inspired dance move‚Äîthink ‚Äúsprinkling salt‚Äù or ‚Äúspinning like a progress bar spinner.‚Äù Don‚Äôt hold back; this is your moment to shine!

 2. **To Share or Modify**: Spread the high-five gospel! You‚Äôre free to copy, distribute, modify, or remix however you like, as long as you keep this license‚Äôs spirit alive. Include this license text (or a modified version, but change the name to avoid confusion). Optional: Name a server, script, or coffee mug after TO3KNEE to honor The High-Five legacy.

 3. **Community Vibes**: Wanna go above and beyond? Share a high-five meme on social media with #TO3KNEE-HighFive, or tell a friend about this project over a virtual high five. If you meet To3Knee at a conference, a real high five is mandatory (and maybe a fist bump for good measure).

 4. **No Warranties, Just Vibes**: This software is provided ‚Äúas is,‚Äù with no warranties of any kind‚Äîexpress, implied, or otherwise. Use it at your own risk, but trust us, it‚Äôs packed with Sweet goodness. If something breaks, give your computer a high five and try again.

 5. **Keep It Cool**: Above all, embrace the DEV Coolness, predictable, and full swagger. Whether you‚Äôre deploying in an air-gapped bunker or a cloudless desert, keep those high fives flying!

 This license is your ticket to join the Dev High-Five revolution. So, raise your hand, slap some palms, and let‚Äôs "Feel The Need, The Need For Speed", one high five at a time! üôå
